🚆 SCR Autopilot Integrated
A complete and modern Roblox Autopilot system for Stepford County Railway with real-time screen vision, full signal logic, multi-class support, and a modular UI.
Now updated for 2025 with Metro support, dynamic OCR integration, and customizable behavior per train class.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧠 Features:

✅ Autopilot Logic

 Acceleration, braking, station stops, door handling, and more—all automated.

🚦 Signal Detection

 Reads signals ahead and reacts accordingly: red, yellow, green logic implemented.

🛑 Station Stop System

 Supports accurate stopping based on car stop markers using OCR and fallback logic.

📺 Visual HUD Reading (OCR)

 Reads in-game GUI elements directly from your screen:
 
 – Current station, next stop, distance, signal distance, delay, etc.

🚄 Train Class Detection

 Automatically detects class: Metro, Connect, Waterline, Express, AirLink, and more.

📊 Debug Mode & Logs
 
 Console logging for internal state, actions taken, class & signal status.

🧩 Modular UI & Configurable System

 Resizable draggable UI with toggles and optional debug output.

🔁 External OCR Integration

 Python script reads the player’s screen and outputs real-time data to JSON for Lua to process.

🧪 Full Support for All Current Train Types

 Handles trains of all lengths and classes, with dynamic route logic.

🧷 Webhook Integration (Optional)

 Sends log or debug data to your Discord via Webhook (configurable).
